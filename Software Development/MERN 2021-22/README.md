# Project

## Intro

This document provides guidance towards pursuing an independent study in building web applications with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It is meant to be used in concert with accountability from a teacher and advice from a mentor.

## Goals

1. Learn the fundamentals of building a web application using a modern framework that is currently in demand in the industry.
1. Produce a project that can be showcased to a future employer and increase the student's chances of getting an interview and job.
1. Practice writing and presentation skills

## Assumptions

- Engaging in this project will be challenging and requires the student to seek out additional resources beyond those available in this document to supplement his or her knowledge through self-study, tenacity, and perseverance. These key skills are required of IT industry practitioners as technology constantly changes requiring on-going study in order to stay up-to-date.
- The student is ultimately responsible for meeting the project milestones and communicating progress to his or her teacher.
- The student will meet monthly with his or her mentor for guidance.
- The student will meet weekly with his or her teacher for accountability

## Assignment

The student will build a web application that allows users to:

- Register
- Log in
- Recover their password (forgot password)
- Manage their profile
- Engage in a meaningful functionality based on the concept he or she chooses

The project's code must be hosted on Github or a similar repository with a full README.md file explaining:

- The project's name and purpose
- How to build, setup, and install the project
- How to run the application

The student must also write about their experience building the application and present their application to their peers and/or teachers, parents, or industry mentors.

# Resources to Learn Web Development With The MERN Stack

The following resources provide a starting point for learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Stack. They are not the only resources required, but they provide a firm foundation to build from.

# Project Milestones

## Planning

Consider the milestones and tasks below. Customize these tasks to match up with your project. Then, apply high-level deadlines to the milestones (Concept, Initial Learning, Building, Write/Present). When you complete the first two milestones ("Concept" and "Learning"), there is another planning task to choose deadlines for specific features. Create those once you get to the "Building" task. This planning process is critical to provide accountability, visibility, and to facilitate communication.

## Concept

- Identify an overall idea for the application. What will the application do? What is its purpose? Who will use it? Why will they use it?
- Observe the workflow used by other websites for the following features:
  - User registration
  - Login
  - Forgot Password
  - My Profile
- Plan and document your desired workflow for those four features
- Identify, document the workflow, and prioritize five high-level features to implement (the priorities are meant to ensure the most important features are implemented first in the case that time runs short)

## Initial MERN Stack Learning

- Consider the resources provided in this document
- Watch those resources and try out the concepts
  - MERN Stack (one or both)
  - GitHub
  - README.md and Markdown

## Building the Application

- Create a schedule for implementing the application's features and present it to your teacher.
- Setup the project including the basic building blocks and database for a MERN stack application
- Create a user registration feature
- Create a login feature
- Create a forgot password feature
- Create a "My Profile" feature that allows users to update their details and password
- Create engaging features supporting your application's purpose and audience
  - Feature 1
  - Feature 2
  - Feature 3
  - Feature 4
  - Feature 5
- Commit your code to Github throughout the process
- Create a README.md file for Github as specified in the requirements above

## Write About and Present Your Project

The purpose of this exercise is to showcase what you accomplished and make yourself more marketable to employers. Employers would be interested in knowing how you taught yourself these development skills, that you were responsible for creating and meeting deadlines, and how you communicated with your teacher and mentor for accountability. Then, focus on your application. What did you build and why? What are its features? What technology choices did you make in building it, and how does the application work? Write about your project with these questions as a guide and place that content on GitHub.

Next, work on your presentation. Imagine you are showcasing the product you have built to a customer. Discuss what your application does, who would use it and why, and what sets this application apart from others like it. Then provide a demo of the application walking through its features.
